📊 Market Research Dashboard with ABSA + SVM + BERT + RoBERTa

🚀 Production-ready NLP system for sentiment intelligence using SVM, BERT, RoBERTa + ABSA + LLM insights.
An end-to-end NLP system for large-scale sentiment analysis and market intelligence built using classical ML, transformer models, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and LLM-powered insights.

This project analyzes customer reviews, detects sentiment, extracts aspect-level opinions, and generates business recommendations through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

🚀 Project Overview

This system was designed to solve a real industry problem:

How can businesses automatically understand customer feedback at scale and extract actionable insights?

The solution combines:
	•	Classical Machine Learning
	•	Transformer-based Deep Learning
	•	Class imbalance handling
	•	Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)
	•	AI-powered insight generation
	•	Interactive analytics dashboard

🧠 Models Implemented

All models were trained on the same dataset split for fair comparison.

1️⃣ SVM (Class-Weighted Baseline)
	•	TF-IDF vectorization
	•	GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning
	•	Class weights to handle imbalance

Performance
	•	Accuracy: 82.51%
	•	Weighted F1: 79.48%
	•	Macro F1: 55.23%

⸻

2️⃣ BERT (Class-Weighted)
	•	Transformer fine-tuning
	•	Weighted cross-entropy loss
	•	Early stopping

Performance
	•	Accuracy: 83.21%
	•	Weighted F1: 84.32%
	•	Macro F1: 66.53%

⸻

3️⃣ RoBERTa (Final Production Model)
	•	Class-weighted training
	•	5–6 epochs + early stopping
	•	Strong contextual sentiment understanding

Performance
	•	Accuracy: 87.63%
	•	Weighted F1: 88.03%
	•	Macro F1: 71.66%
	
RoBERTa improved accuracy by +5% over SVM and +4% over BERT.


| Model    | Accuracy | Weighted F1 | Macro F1 |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| SVM      | 82.51%   | 79.48%      | 55.23%   |
| BERT     | 83.21%   | 84.32%      | 66.53%   |
| RoBERTa  | 87.63%   | 88.03%      | 71.66%   |

⚖️ Class Imbalance Strategy

Dataset distribution:
	•	Positive → dominant class
	•	Negative → medium
	•	Neutral → minority (hardest class)

Techniques explored:
	•	Random undersampling
	•	SMOTE
	•	Class weights (final choice)

Final decision:
Class-weighted training preserved data volume and delivered the best performance.

⸻

🔍 Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

Integrated DeBERTa ABSA model to extract sentiment across business-critical aspects:
	•	Price
	•	Quality
	•	Delivery
	•	Service
	•	Packaging
	•	Quantity

Enables insights like:
	•	“Customers like product quality but complain about delivery”
	•	“Pricing dissatisfaction increasing over time”
